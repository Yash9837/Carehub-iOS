# CareHub — Comprehensive Hospital Management System (iOS)

## 🚑 Overview

CareHub is a comprehensive, scalable, and secure **Hospital Management System** designed as a native iOS application using Swift, SwiftUI, Firebase, and Core Data.
The goal was to create a unified platform that streamlines hospital operations while offering a seamless experience for patients, doctors, nurses, lab technicians, accountants, and administrators.

This app is not built for a single hospital but designed to be easily adopted and customized across different healthcare institutions.
